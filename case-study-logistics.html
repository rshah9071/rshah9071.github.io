            <h3>Client Challenge:</h3>
            <p>A large distribution company was facing inefficiencies in their complex logistics operations, including route planning, fleet management, and real-time shipment tracking. Their existing systems were disparate and lacked proper integration, leading to delays and increased operational costs.</p>

            <h3>InnovateTech Solution:</h3>
            <p>We developed a comprehensive web-based Logistics Management System (LMS) that integrated various aspects of their supply chain. The system features advanced algorithms for optimal route planning, GPS integration for real-time tracking, and modules for warehouse inventory management and order fulfillment. The solution was built using ASP.NET Core for the backend and Angular for the frontend, with SQL Server for data management.</p>

            <h3>Key Features Implemented:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic route optimization and scheduling</li>
                <li>Real-time fleet tracking and monitoring</li>
                <li>Automated dispatch and delivery management</li>
                <li>Warehouse inventory and stock level management</li>
                <li>Customer portal for shipment tracking</li>
                <li>Analytics and reporting on operational efficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results:</h3>
            <p>The new LMS resulted in a **15% reduction in fuel costs** due to optimized routes and a **20% improvement in on-time deliveries**. The company also saw a significant reduction in customer service inquiries related to shipment status, improving overall customer satisfaction.</p>
